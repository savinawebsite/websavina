                <p>Sometimes, to film in the studio is not enough. And sometimes, not even our own back yard is enough. In those cases, it's not practical to carry all your things along with you. If you are going to film on location, you can count on us.</p>
                <p><b>Toolbox</b> offers <b>rent and servicing</b> – staff and equipment. Namely: the best staff and the best equipment. We are gearheads, we admit it: technology fans, with a collection of high-end equipment (from high definition digital cameras to the most complex lighting and grip accessories. And, as true gearheads, we know how to boost this equipment's potential to the limit.</p>
                <p>But despite all this fixation with cold technology, we use it to capture the most vibrant and warm things. An example of this is our country: Portugal has the light, the architecture, the landscape – and we have the people with the sensitivity to see it.</p>
                <p>Come film with us and enjoy the amazing landscapes and people, don't let logistic concerns get in your way. With Toolbox your only concern is to choose the weapons, because if it shoots, we move it.</p>
